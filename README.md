**No URURU, just LRU**

Yet another LRU cache implementation. But why? Yeah, there are a few reasons for that:

1. Simplicity in implementation means better _maintainability_.
2. Simplicity in interface means better _learnability_ (see "ISO/IEC 9126 Software engineering â€” Product quality").
3. Zero dependencies means more _predictability_, _safety_ and reduces overall application _size_.
