## Implementation details

| Operation  | Time complexity | Space complexity | Description                               |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `stats`    | $O(1)$          | $O(1)$           | Get cache statistics.                     |
| `capacity` | $$              | $$               | Set new capacity value.                   |
| `read`     | $O(1)$          | $O(1)$           | Read value by its key.                    |
| `add`      | $O(1)$          | $O(1)$           | Add value by corresponding key.           |
| `has`      | $O(1)$          | $O(1)$           | Check if there is a value by given key.   |
| `remove`   | $O(1)$          | $O(1)$           | Remove value by associated key.           |
| `clear`    | $O(1)$          | $O(1)$           | Remove cached data and release resources. |

## General theory

Random replacement policy selects a cached item randomly for eviction when the cache is full. It doesnâ€™t consider access patterns or usage history.

This caching algorithm may be used when no specific access patterns are known or when simplicity is preferred.
